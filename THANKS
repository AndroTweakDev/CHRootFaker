The chrootFaker project was started as dirty hack because I've got an access
to some system without root privileges. This is an Open Source project. 

I'm glad to see that fchrootFaker had found another purposes:

  * to be a part of Klik application installer (http://klik.atekon.de)
  * to be a supporter for pbuilder building system
    (http://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/)
  * to be a supporter for febootstrap - a tool for bootstraping Fedora system
    (http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/febootstrap/)
  * to be a supporter for Apport retracer
    (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport)
  * to be a part of Slind - a minimal Debian-based distro for embedded devices
    (https://www.slind.org/Main_Page)
  * to be a part of scratchbox - the cross-compilation toolkit project
    (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/sbox2)

I would like to thank to:

  * Marcin Jakubowski <user@debian.pl>, for an inspiration
  * joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>, for its fakeroot
  * Lionel Tricon <lionel.tricon@free.fr>, for an exclude path list feature
  * Mark Eichin <eichin@metacarta.com>, for countless patches with bugfixes
  * Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>, for great Ubuntu support
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>, for testing
